        <p>Red Bull Home Ground is returning for its fourth year, with the 2023 competition taking place in Tokyo, Japan.
            Last year, eight of the greatest Valorant teams from around the world convened in Manchester, UK, with 100 Thieves ultimately taking home the trophy after days of intense competition. This time around, one of Tokyo's most iconic venues – the historic Sumo arena Ryogoku Kokugikan – will be the proving ground, pitting the best teams from Japan and across the world against each other in a battle to be number one.
        </p>
        <p>Built in 1985, the huge stadium can house more than 10,000 visitors and has been home to sumo events, live gigs and even Olympic-grade boxing. With an iconic backdrop set to light up the competition, who will emerge victorious?</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">3. A New Agent </h2>
            <img src="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6531307511096cbdafbfb009/Valorant-agent-Iso-artwork/960x0.png?format=png&width=1440" class="mworldpic"/>
                <div class="mpl-notes">
                     <P>Riot Games has revealed that Iso is the new agent coming to Valorant with the launch of Episode 7 Act III, and he can trap opponents in a 1v1 battle arena thanks to his controversial ultimate.

                        Billed as a Chinese fixer for hire, Iso uses ambient energy around the map to provide himself with shields, cover and giant 1v1 arenas. As a duelist, his abilities are focused on killing opponents with only limited team play utility, and on paper, it seems that he is very adept at doing so.</P>
                    <p>“The goal [for Iso] was to create an exciting duelist that emphasized gunplay and excitement,” said Nicholas “Nickwu” Smith, a game designer on Valorant. “We had a few outputs we wanted to avoid, specifically mobility and healing. Since we weren’t doing Mobility or Healing, I wanted Iso to feel distinct and what I'd call a Juggernaut. It’s why we created the shield, and that he’d run a team through and keep on going without mobility or healing.”

                    </p>
                    <p>His Q ability is called Undercut and is perhaps the most standard ability in his arsenal. Simply use the ability to fire a blot in a direction that can pass through walls. Any enemies that it hits will become fragile for a limited time, making them easier to take down.</p>
                    <p>his C ability, Contingency. This is likely to prove a controversial one, as it generates a massive, moving, wall of energy that both blocks sight and bullets. Pop this out as soon as you see an enemy and they will have to move or wait for it to pass, giving you the upper hand.</p>
                    <P>Finally his ultimate is Kill Contract and this one is sure to irritate some. Unleashing this ability will pull you and the first enemy it hits into a 1v1 duel, complete with a custom arena that keeps enemies out. It looks impressive and seems to truly create a true 1v1, however, that somewhat goes against the idea of Valorant being a highly tactical team shooter.</P>
