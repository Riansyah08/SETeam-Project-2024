    <p>The Genshin Impact 4.2 livestream will be a grand event for players who want to learn more about the future of HoYoverse’s popular action RPG. As a live service game, Genshin Impact regularly receives new versions, which patch the title with more playable characters, story missions, limited-time events, and even quality-of-life updates. These patches are installed every six weeks in Genshin Impact, but before they actually arrive, the developer holds a special livestream event to announce most of the content that will be added. The livestream is where new characters, story details, and more content expected for Version 4.2 will be officially confirmed.</p>
    <P>Of course, for more content-hungry players, not much will actually be new, as there have been several Genshin Impact 4.2 leaks and rumors shared so far. Leaks have been plaguing the game for quite some time, but the large batch of information shared ahead of the release of the Fontaine region was surprising – and most of it was accurate. As such, even if they should be taken with a grain of salt because they can be wrong or subject to change, leaks are considered mostly trustworthy. Those attuned to leaks should already know what characters are arriving in the upcoming version, as well as how they play out.</P>

    <h2>2. New Characters, Story Updates, & More</h2>

    <p>Possibly one of the most important pieces of content is the set of new characters in Genshin Impact 4.2. HoYoverse has already confirmed that two heroes are being added through the patch: Furina and Charlotte. Furina is expected to be a 5-star Hydro character, as she is the vessel for the Hydro Archon, Focalors. Charlotte, on the other hand, will be a Cryo character and is expected to be ranked as a 4-star hero. While their names and elemental prowess are the only actual bits of information shared by the developer, there are leaks that provide more information about them, including the aforementioned rarities.</p>
    <P>Furina’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact 4.2, for instance, confirms that she will be a sword user and that she will have an exclusive mechanic that plays around with the Arkhe system. While most Fontaine characters are aligned to either Ousia or Pneuma, Furina’s leaks indicate she will be able to manipulate both forms of energy on the field. By analyzing the details of her abilities, it is possible to assume that Furina will be a new 5-star Hydro support and sub-DPS character in the game, as she will deal a decent amount of damage and provide buffs to the team – and even some healing.</P>
    <p>The other new character to be confirmed and detailed during the Version 4.2 livestream should be Charlotte. According to Charlotte’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact, she will also be a support and sub-DPS character, though she will mostly operate while off-field. From what was leaked until now, it seems like her focus will be providing healing to the team, while also spreading Cryo for the rest of the party to trigger Elemental Reactions. Her healing abilities will scale off of her ATK stat, which seems positive. The leaked information also indicates that Charlotte will be the second Cryo catalyst character in the game, following Wriothesley’s release in Version 4.1.</p>
